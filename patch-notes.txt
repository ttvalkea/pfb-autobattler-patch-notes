|PATCH NOTES |
--------------
23.08.2023
- Damage summary added

22.08.2023
- New melee bot added, Gnoll: Cost 7, attack 3, defence 1, hit points 6, move speed 1
- Gauss hit points from 4 to 5

21.08.2023
- Musketeer cost from 6 to 7
- Tech cost from 7 to 8
- Fly bonus distance from 2 to 3
- In the first game, players always have 4 bots and 1 upgrade instead of 3-4 bots and 1-2 upgrades to choose from
- Player now always sees their bots on the bottom of the screen instead of sometimes being inverted to the top

20.08.2023
- New bot type added, Flyer
    - Same as a melee bot except for first two turns. On first and second turn, walks towards opponent's backline. At the end of second turn, flies to enemy's backline, to closest empty tile. Has to rest afterwards, if flying distance is greater than ‚è© + 2.
- Two new flyer bots added
    - Pegasos, Cost 10, attack 3, defence 1, hit points 7, move speed 2
    - Gargoyle, Cost 7, attack 2, defence 1, hit points 6, move speed 2

19.08.2023
- Previously, each bot was equally likely to show up in the buy options. Now, there's a system in place allowing for bots to have different probabilities.
    - This system works like a pool out of which a random bot is chosen and currently there's one of each bot in the pool except for Inferno of which there are two.

18.08.2023
- Added paging to game list

17.08.2023
- Visual upgrades:
    - Combat view should now fit better onto the screen with screen resolutions <1440p 
    - Basic info about bots added to How to play
    - Added game name, date and combat number to lobby's combat viewer
    - Tooltip added to bots' type

16.08.2023
- Added combat observing tool to lobby
    - Note that for older matches, there might be visual bugs in the presentation (regarding shooters and casters, at least).
- Visual upgrade: Show an icon for the event taking place

15.08.2023
- Visual upgrades:
    - Bots' hit points are now shown as a bar
    - Bots' loaded/charged status is now shown

13.08.2023

11.08.2023
- Tech hit points from 2 to 3, cost from 8 to 7
- Musketeer cost from 8 to 6
- New shooter bot added, Gauss. Cost 11, attack 4, defence 0, hit points 4
- New bot type added, Fire Caster
    - Fire Caster casts a spell every other turn, recharging in between. It switches between two spells. Firstly, it'll cast Firebolt. Secondly, Meteor.
        - Firebolt: a 2 damage projectile, cast at the weakest visible enemy. 
            - Weakness here has a slightly different definition as with melee and shooter bots, as in priority step 2, instead of choosing the highest attack enemy, the enemy with the highest attack+defence value is chosen. 
        - Meteor: a 2x2 tile area of effect spell, dealing 2 damage to each enemy it hits.
            - Meteor is cast to a position where there are most targets. In case of several areas with equal amounts of targets, select a random area with the weakest bot. No line of sight needed.

10.08.2023
- Melee bot behavior change:
    - Previosly, when there were several equidistant targets, one was chosen randomly and that target was kept until a closer target appeared.
    - Now, if there are equidistant targets, the weakest one is chosen as the target.

- Change to the definition of bot weakness for targeting:
    Now, weakness is defined as follows:
    Priority 1: How many attacks does it take to destroy the enemy. The less, the weaker the enemy.
    Priority 2: In case of tie in last category, choose the one with the highest attack.
    Priority 3: In case of tie in last category, choose the one with the highest remaining health.
    Lastly, if there are still more than one option, choose randomly.

    - Previosly, the definition was the same but without priorities 2 and 3

- Spinner hit points from 5 to 4
- Arena size increased from 7x8 to 7x9
- Fixed a bug that allowed buying an upgrade several times by clicking fast 

09.08.2023

    - Game list's games are returned so that newest games are on top instead bottom
    - Added more details to instruction text
    - Upgrades are now shown in bot's stat numbers instead of just showing the upgrade icon
    - "Go to next event" button shouldn't move that as much between clicks as before

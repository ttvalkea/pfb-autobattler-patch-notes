        - Firebolt: a 2 damage projectile, cast at the weakest visible enemy. 
            - Weakness here has a slightly different definition as with melee and shooter bots, as in priority step 2, instead of choosing the highest attack enemy, the enemy with the highest attack+defence value is chosen. 
        - Meteor: a 2x2 tile area of effect spell, dealing 2 damage to each enemy it hits.
            - Meteor is cast to a position where there are most targets. In case of several areas with equal amounts of targets, select a random area with the weakest bot. No line of sight needed.

10.08.2023
- Melee bot behavior change:
    - Previosly, when there were several equidistant targets, one was chosen randomly and that target was kept until a closer target appeared.
    - Now, if there are equidistant targets, the weakest one is chosen as the target.

- Change to the definition of bot weakness for targeting:
    Now, weakness is defined as follows:
    Priority 1: How many attacks does it take to destroy the enemy. The less, the weaker the enemy.
    Priority 2: In case of tie in last category, choose the one with the highest attack.
    Priority 3: In case of tie in last category, choose the one with the highest remaining health.
    Lastly, if there are still more than one option, choose randomly.

    - Previosly, the definition was the same but without priorities 2 and 3

- Spinner hit points from 5 to 4

    - Added more details to instruction text
    - Upgrades are now shown in bot's stat numbers instead of just showing the upgrade icon
    - "Go to next event" button shouldn't move that as much between clicks as before

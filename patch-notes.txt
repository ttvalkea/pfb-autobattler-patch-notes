        - Meteor: a 2x2 tile area of effect spell, dealing 2 damage to each enemy it hits.
            - Meteor is cast to a position where there are most targets. In case of several areas with equal amounts of targets, select a random area with the weakest bot. No line of sight needed.

10.08.2023

    - Now, if there are equidistant targets, the weakest one is chosen as the target.

- Change to the definition of bot weakness for targeting:
    Now, weakness is defined as follows:
    Priority 1: How many attacks does it take to destroy the enemy. The less, the weaker the enemy.
    Priority 2: In case of tie in last category, choose the one with the highest attack.
    Priority 3: In case of tie in last category, choose the one with the highest remaining health.
    Lastly, if there are still more than one option, choose randomly.
